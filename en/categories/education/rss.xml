      <description>DARIAH-DE supports digitally-enabled research and teaching in the arts and humanities. The project developed research infrastructure in support of service and research data as well as materials for research and teaching in the Digital Humanities.
DARIAH-DE is the german national contribution to the European research infrastructure &amp;ldquo;DARIAH-EU - Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities&amp;rdquo; within the framework of ESFRI.
As a project partner, we supported DARIAH-DE with the communication and dissemination of the alignment, content, and results of digital humanities.</description>

      <description>DatenmachenSchule shows the potential open data in the classroom. The initial idea for the project came from a study published in 2013 on the subject of Open Data by the Fraunhofer Focus Institute:
&amp;ldquo;Open administrative data [&amp;hellip;] in principle holds the chance of a new educational design (Open Educational Resources)&amp;ldquo;.
In order to pursue this thesis, a cooperation between the administration of the city of Moers, the Gymnasium Adolfinum, the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences and the Open Knowledge Lab Niederrhein was formed.</description>

      <description>The Data School is a nationwide educational program on the subject of data and technologies. We mainly target non-profit organisations that work with data, or alternatively want to deepen their existing data knowledge. Within a cooperation period of about three months, we developed practice-oriented workshops and individualized technical training courses with our partners and trainers to support social projects.
We want non-profit organisations:
 to encourage targeted use of data and technology in their work.</description>

      <description>How can we empower children and young adults today to become the shapers of tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s society? What makes young adults more visible as actors? What role do digital technologies play here? And how can participation succeed on both the digital and social levels?
In order to answer these and other questions, we have developed various workshop formats and materials with the democracy labs in order to help a broad target group of children and young adults to experience self-efficacy in the field of democracy and technology.</description>

      <description>The shaping of family life in Germany has changed enormously in recent decades. Patchwork families, multi-generation houses and households of single parents bring completely different requirements with them. One of the biggest challenges is the compatibility of family and career. Or to put it another way: is it really necessary to have to sit in a doctor&amp;rsquo;s waiting room for three hours each time? We think that this can work better.</description>

      <description>The Turing Bus is a mobile educational project for schools and youth clubs in rural areas. The bus brings representatives of Fablabs, OK-Labs and Hackspaces as well as experts in digital topics to often underserved places of youth education. Its goal is to generate an exchange of knowledge and experiences through workshops, discussions, screenings, and more. The project is funded in the Science Year of the BMBF.
The Bus wants to explore, discuss, and critically question the role of digitisation and technology in the professional landscape and society as a whole.</description>

      <description>edulabs sees itself as a supra-regional incubator in which people use their didactic, technical, and creative skills to develop innovative and re-usable educational materials. The project works on three levels: concept development, provision and advertising of open educational resources as well as community building and support. Throughout Germany, edulabs organises meetings of interdisciplinary teams where open educational resources and digitally supported methods are evaluated, created, documented, and improved. The lab community is supported editorially, didactically, technically, as well as with the organisation of events.</description>
