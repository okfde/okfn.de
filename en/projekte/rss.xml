      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the successful first Bits &amp;amp; Bäume Conference in 2018, the topics of digitalization and sustainability are more present in our society today than ever before. We are facing major societal and global challenges for a just and sustainable shaping of our (surrounding) world. Therefore, we would like to broaden and consolidate the networking of environmental and justice activists, technology experts and human rights activists with the &lt;strong&gt;Bits &amp;amp; Bäume 2022 conference from September 30 to October 2, 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; This also includes networking our communities with representatives of social-ecological small digital businesses and founders as well as politicians in order to find concrete solutions for the pressing issues of our time. We want to discuss major political strategies and governance proposals, but also learn from each other through best practice examples how we can realize climate and environmental protection, social justice, democracy and fundamental rights in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Open Government Network, we support Germany&amp;rsquo;s active participation in the Open Government Partnership (OGP) and the interests of German civil society in this process, as well as help coordinate this civil society network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network is an association of civil society organisations and individuals that has been working since 2011 to promote open government and administrative action as a holistic approach to strengthening democracy. In particular, the focus is on the exchange with the Federal Government and the development of national action plans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Turing Bus is a mobile educational project for schools and youth clubs in rural areas. The bus brings representatives of Fablabs, OK-Labs and Hackspaces as well as experts in digital topics to often underserved places of youth education. Its goal is to generate an exchange of knowledge and experiences through workshops, discussions, screenings, and more. The project is funded in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wissenschaftsjahr.de&#34;&gt;Science Year&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bmbf.de&#34;&gt;BMBF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bus wants to explore, discuss, and critically question the role of digitisation and technology in the professional landscape and society as a whole. It engages young adults between the ages of 15 and 20 with workshops, lectures, as well as hands-on sessions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the Prototype Fund, we support socially relevant software projects and increase their sustainable impact through open source by principle. In short: We fund open source software made by society and for society.
We make digital social innovation possible with developers who bring a wide range of skills to technology design and are given the space to develop their good ideas. You will receive funding of up to €95,000 over six months or €158,000 over ten months for your project and team. The fund supports software developers, hackers, and creative minds in turning sketches for tools and applications into reality. The Prototype Fund has redefinied its funding priorities since 2025 and now focuses on the areas of data security and software infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Public authorities from federal to local level produce and publish thousands of documents every day. In the context of the omnipresent digitalisation of public services, many goals have been set in recent years concerning the use of open data standards. However, the implementation fell short of the target so far. There is a great need for public authorities to build up knowledge and competences in the field of data provision. With this project the OKF wants to put its focus again on one of its core topics: contributing to the social discourse by offering our expertise in the field of open data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a democracy, it is essential that citizens are able to freely access information about government actions. The Freedom of Information Act gives everyone the right to request documents from public authorities. With the online platform FragDenStaat, we support citizens in exercising their right to access information from German authorities. Citizens no longer have to wade through the jungle of federal and state laws to submit a request. Requests and responses are published transparently online. In the year the project was launched, the number of requests for information in Germany doubled.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://okfn.de/en/projekte/codeforde/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Code for Germany is a network of volunteers working on sustainable digital projects for an open and fair society. The central theme is how data, information and knowledge can be processed in such a way that they are accessible to as many people as possible. This strengthens citizens&amp;rsquo; participation in democratic processes and makes their everyday lives easier. To make this possible, volunteers meet regularly in their cities in Open Knowledge Labs (OK Labs). They discuss open government strategies and develop digital solutions to problems and needs they have identified in their cities and neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Improving the world with code – that has been the goal of Jugend hackt since 2013, a programme for young people between the ages of 12 and 18 who are interested in technology and want to explore how technology and society are connected. At Jugend hackt, we do code and tinker, of course, but we are interested in more than that. We want to teach responsible use of technology. For us, this includes exploring ethical hacking, but also the openness of code and data. Tech skills are more than just something that looks good on a CV.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2030Watch monitors the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Germany.
The SDGs were set by the United Nations in September 2015 and will be implemented by 2030.
All members of the United Nations have committed to realising these 17 goals and 169 targets.
The goals include the eradication of poverty and inequality between and within countries, as well as action against climate change.
2030Watch primarily uses data from the OECD, the World Bank and other international organisations.
The project will also propose indicators for goals which are hard to operationalize, such as fair trade relations.
The launch of the 2030 Watch website is planned for the end of October 2015.
The project budget for 2015 is 55.620 Euro.
73% of the budget is funded by the German ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The other funders are Welthungerhilfe (9%), Brot für die Welt/EED (9%) and Terre des Hommes (7%).
The remaining funds are private donations (below 1%).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Together with AlgorithmWatch, the Society for Civil Rights, Reporters Without Borders and Wikimedia Germany, we have joined forces in the F5 alliance to advocate for the concerns, ideas and demands of the digital civil society in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are united in the aspiration to ensure democratic digitization built on the pillars of openness and transparency, participation and access, protection of fundamental and human rights, and protection of consumer concerns. Our goal is to put the common good at the heart of digital policy and ensure the future of a democratic digital society. That&#39;s why we pool our expertise in the various topic areas of digitization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coding da Vinci is the first cultural data hackathon in Germany that brings together cultural heritage institutions and the hacker/designer community to develop ideas and prototypes for both the cultural sector and the public.
More and more galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs) are digitalising their collections to make them accessible online and to preserve our heritage for future generations. Only when cultural data is made openly available (according to the Open Definition) can it serve as the creative basis for innovative new applications and projects. Coding da Vinci proactively approaches GLAMs and encourages them to release cultural data, in order to offer their participants a platform to experiment and to innovate.
Further information is available on the project website: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codingdavinci.de/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;codingdavinci.de&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DARIAH-DE supports digitally-enabled research and teaching in the arts and humanities. The project developed research infrastructure in support of service and research data as well as materials for research and teaching in the Digital Humanities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DARIAH-DE is the german national contribution to the European research infrastructure &amp;ldquo;DARIAH-EU - Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities&amp;rdquo; within the framework of ESFRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a project partner, we supported DARIAH-DE with the communication and dissemination of the alignment, content, and results of digital humanities.
By supporting digitally-enabled research and teaching in the arts and humanities, we hope to advance the field and  expand the use of digital content, resources, tools, and open research infrastructure in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://okfn.de/en/projekte/datenmachenschule/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DatenmachenSchule shows the potential open data in the classroom. The initial idea for the project came from a study published in 2013 on the subject of Open Data by the Fraunhofer Focus Institute:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Open administrative data [&amp;hellip;] in principle holds the chance of a new educational design (Open Educational Resources)&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to pursue this thesis, a cooperation between the administration of the city of Moers, the Gymnasium Adolfinum, the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences and the Open Knowledge Lab Niederrhein was formed. The findings and experiences developed from this cooperation were collected in DatenmachenSchule.de and processed in the form of a guide and the corresponding website. Based on feedback from the project, the election results portal and the OffenerHaushalt tool were technically and visually redesigned and loaded with new data in order to facilitate their subsequent use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Data School is a nationwide educational program on the subject of data and technologies. We mainly target non-profit organisations that work with data, or alternatively want to deepen their existing data knowledge. Within a cooperation period of about three months, we developed practice-oriented workshops and individualized technical training courses with our partners and trainers to support social projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want non-profit organisations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to encourage targeted use of data and technology in their work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How can we empower children and young adults today to become the shapers of tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s society? What makes young adults more visible as actors? What role do digital technologies play here? And how can participation succeed on both the digital and social levels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to answer these and other questions, we have developed various workshop formats and materials with the democracy labs in order to help a broad target group of children and young adults to experience self-efficacy in the field of democracy and technology. The formats are designed for different target groups of extracurricular youth education. On the one hand, they enable workshop leaders to communicate topics such as cyberbullying, fake news, populism, urban design, data protection, influencing, diversity, and freedom of expression. On the other hand, we developed self-learning materials that young adults can use independently to learn about social topics and digital tools, as well as implement their own projects. In addition, we have carried out training courses for specialists with the Data School in order to make use of the opportunities of digitisation in everyday extracurricular youth work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The allocation of funds through public procurement (services, bulding contracts, and goods) represents a significant share of state expenditure. In the EU, this amounts to about 16% of the GDP. In many cases, the allocation of these contracts is not conducted transparently. As a result, 20-25% of the total number of orders can be lost to corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to change this, we are working together with five partners on the EU project, DIGIWHIST. We not only aim to increase the level of trust placed in governments, we also intend to make public procurement in Europe more efficient. To do so, we are systematically collecting, structuring, and analyzing information on public procurement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;edulabs sees itself as a supra-regional incubator in which people use their didactic, technical, and creative skills to develop innovative and re-usable educational materials. The project works on three levels: concept development, provision and advertising of open educational resources as well as community building and support. Throughout Germany, edulabs organises meetings of interdisciplinary teams where open educational resources and digitally supported methods are evaluated, created, documented, and improved. The lab community is supported editorially, didactically, technically, as well as with the organisation of events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Energyhack is a hackathon around open energy data. Our energy supply and the ways of its generation are manifold. But how is energy distributed and how do we ensure that more information can be exchanged between producers and consumers? Together with developers, designers, and researchers, thought leaders in the energy industry brainstorm ideas, design, and develop prototypes in 24 hours. The data from the Open Data Portal Netzdaten-Berlin was available to the participants as a database.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The shaping of family life in Germany has changed enormously in recent decades. Patchwork families, multi-generation houses and households of single parents bring completely different requirements with them. One of the biggest challenges is the compatibility of family and career. Or to put it another way: is it really necessary to have to sit in a doctor&amp;rsquo;s waiting room for three hours each time? We think that this can work better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The aim is to obtain detailed data on payments and beneficiaries of agricultural subsidies in each EU Member State, and to make this data available in a way that is useful for European citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, we took over the project on a voluntary basis in order to guarantee the continuity of the project. We are responsible for the cleansing, compilation, and presentation of the data received. We also provide training and analysis of the data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Frankfurt Gestalten was a participatory platform by and for citizens in Frankfurt. We believe that there are many great ideas for a better city and want to connect the people behind these ideas. We documented events in local politics and served as a hub for urban development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;https.jetzt! shows how many government websites support encryption via HTTPS. Why is website encryption important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any unencrypted transmission of data can be intercepted on the Internet and thus manipulated. Therefore, it is obvious that any transmission of sensitive data, such as orders in online shops, online banking, or logins to websites with non-public content should always be encrypted. For the user this means: when in doubt you should always check in your browser whether an encrypted transmission is displayed there. Serious and professional providers will not request data from the customer via unencrypted channels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The right to ask questions is an important right of MPs - and a frequently used parliamentary control instrument. In the German parliament alone, thousands of so-called &amp;ldquo;small questions&amp;rdquo; are asked in each parliamentary term, which must be answered in writing by the government. If you add the questions asked in the parliaments of the federal states, a huge pool of useful information results which is scattered throughout the various online archives. On kleineanfragen.de we collect and bundle these documents and make them - as a contribution to transparency and participation - more easily accessible for the public.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Open Data Incubator for Europe (ODINE) was a 6-month incubator for open data entrepreneurs across Europe. The programme was funded with a grant of €7.8 million from the EU Horizon 2020 programme and was implemented by seven partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ODINE aimed to support the next generation of digital enterprises and help them accelerate the development of their products. We are already committed to the best European digital talent and look forward to more outstanding companies to be founded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://okfn.de/en/projekte/offenedaten/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of Offene Daten was to create the prototype of a data portal for openly accessible administrative data that had not been available in Germany before. Offenedaten.de was used as a data catalogue for the Apps 4 Germany competition, which took place in 2011. In this competition, 77 innovative applications for citizens were developed from 320 data sets and 112 ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2014, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://beta.offenedaten.de&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;beta version of the portal&lt;/a&gt; will also contain the total metadata of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.open-data-map.de&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Open Data Monitor&lt;/a&gt; project. The aim was to record the offers of open data in the public sector in Germany as comprehensively as possible, to process them according to subject areas and to make them searchable in a user-friendly and geographical manner with reasonable effort. (= 11,191 municipalities, several dozen state authorities per federal state, federal authorities and public enterprises at all three levels).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Federal Law Gazettes are the central documents of German democracy. At OffeneGesetze.de they are now freely accessible for the first time. On our new portal, we make these documents available free of charge and for unrestricted use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Federal Law Gazettes were only available via the website bgbl.de of the Bundesanzeiger Verlag. The private publishing house requires subscription fees for basic functions, for example searching or printing of law gazettes. The publisher prohibits further use of the documents with reference to copyright.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The central task of a parliament is to draw up and debate a budget. This essential political process decides which activities the state can carry out and which services cannot be provided. Budget data must be published by law. Unfortunately, budget data format is not standardised, which means that booklets with more than 1000 pages are printed and slowly deteriorate in the town hall or placed as PDF files on the corresponding websites. As a result, an essential aspect of political work remains closed off to many.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The corporate registry is the public repository of companies, foundations and associations in Germany. It contains data about legal status, address and officers of an entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data is important for trust in business and the people involved. However, this data is not made openly accessible by the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with &lt;a href=&#34;https://opencorporates.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OpenCorporates&lt;/a&gt; we published the German corporate registry as open data for the first time.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many municipalities, counties and regions in Germany have council information systems at their disposal in order to organise committee work in local councils and at district assemblies. A lot of information is hidden in these council information systems of German municipalities. The entire municipal policy is documented - decisions that have a direct impact on the inhabitants of the city. Nonetheless, to involve citizens and their creative potential in the city&amp;rsquo;s politics, it is important to provide information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenBudgets was an EU Horizon 2020 funded project that aims to make government budget data more accessible in a centralized and transparent way. On the basis of an open source framework, a Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) portal will be created through which stakeholders (e.g. journalists, members of parliament, citizens, NGOs) can find and export budget data and present it with the help of a visualization library. The project seeks to open up new possibilities for comparison and analysis in order to enable greater transparency. It also strives to more effectively fight corruption in public finance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your application for a mortgage is declined, you cannot get a mobile phone contract, and even with your apartment searches you constantly lose out. Why is that? The SCHUFA, of course! Really? Does SCHUFA disadvantage one group of people compared to another? Does it reinforce injustices? This is what we want to find out with OpenSCHUFA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SCHUFA score tries to summarise the financial trustworthiness of a person in a few numbers - the scores. These are automatically determined and form the basis for far-reaching decisions. We need to understand this process better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The open council information system &amp;ldquo;Politik Bei Uns&amp;rdquo; presents information and processes from council and administration in a user-friendly way, so that citizens can understand political decisions and can have a say at an early stage. As a data market place, our project makes council and administrative data available to third-party developers so that they can build further applications without much effort. Apart from politics, civil society and journalists, the scientific community also benefits from structured and therefore analysable data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Together with partner institutions in Germany, Greece and the Netherlands, the refugee phrasebook team develops sustainable communication tools to share phrases, icons and other helpful resources. All materials are adaptable for local needs and distributed with open licences to foster communication between refugees, citizens and helpers all over Europe. Our goal is to empower refugees all across Europe to communicate and voice their needs, independently of network access and battery life, even if they can only stay in a country for a limited time. With adaptable designs and collections of important phrases, links and essential information, we aim to connect and support initiatives with refugee groups to foster a welcoming culture combined with the values of an open society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the campaign &lt;a href=&#34;https://netzpolitik.org/2016/frag-den-bundestag-4000-gutachten-warten-darauf-befreit-zu-werden/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; #FragDenBundestag&lt;/a&gt; by FragDenStaat and Abgeordnetenwatch, the German parliament decided to publish all reports of its scientific service online. In the three weeks leading up to that decision, thousands of users have requested expert opinions via FragDenBundestag.de, which the German parliament has to publish according to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the documents have not been prepared - the list is unclear and not searchable. That is why there is sehrGutachten: a platform that presents the reports in a structured way to make them searchable in full text. This enables a number of possibilities: reports on topics such as security policy, finance, criminal law, asylum law and European policy are now available for scientific analysis, journalists, and civil society actors. Readers can obtain information about uploaded reports via feed, and developers can obtain data about the reports in JSON format.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of a feasibility study funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, we examined the needs and possibilities for a funding program to strengthen open digital infrastructure. The idea for a fund is based, among other things, on Open Technology Funds Core Infrastructure Fund and can learn from this and the experiences from other programs, e.g. the Prototype Fund, and adopt already tested procedures. For the design of the Sovereign Tech Fund, numerous other existing programs were analyzed, interviews were conducted with developers and stakeholders in the open source ecosystem, and expert workshops were held.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the project &amp;ldquo;Stadt Land Code&amp;rdquo; we wanted to encourage developers to create useful digital applications for the public space.
These applications were meant to serve as the foundation for participatory mechanisms and increased transparency in public administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples for such applications include &lt;a href=&#34;https://fixmystreet.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;www.fixmystreet.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://everyblock.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;www.everyblock.com&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to Article 5 of the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz), every person has the right to obtain free information from generally accessible sources. That sounds promising at first. But for a long time there was a lack of generally accessible sources. It was not until the turn of the millennium that many German states took a big step: freedom of information was the order of the day. Through freedom of information laws, the first state parliaments in Berlin and Brandenburg obliged local administrations and state authorities to renounce the previously valid official secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Berlin coalition agreement, the governing parties agreed to further develop the Berlin Freedom of Information Act into a transparency law. However, a concrete draft has not yet been worked out. We want to change that. Together with civil society partners, we have written a draft for a Berlin Transparency Act. Within the framework of a referendum, we will implement the draft law for the whole of Berlin by 2021.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Museums, archives, libraries and momuments are operated and maintained with public funds.
The international conference &amp;ldquo;Zugang gestalten&amp;rdquo; asks the question whether this is adequately reflected in the level of access to the cultural treasures that these institutions possess and maintain.
The conference invites key figures in culture, science, civic society and politics to publicly explore different ways of accessing digital cultural heritage in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Zugang gestalten&amp;rdquo; stands under the auspices of the German UNESCO commission and is a collaboartive project of the Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland, Stiftung Historische Museen Hamburg, Servicestelle Digitalisierung Berlin, Deutschen Digitalen Bibliothek, Internet &amp;amp; Gesellschaft Collaboratory, Institut Français Deutschland, iRights.info, Jüdischen Museum Berlin, Stiftung Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz and Wikimedia Deutschland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
