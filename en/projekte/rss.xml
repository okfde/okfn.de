      <description>As part of the Open Government Network, we support Germany&amp;rsquo;s active participation in the Open Government Partnership (OGP) and the interests of German civil society in this process, as well as help coordinate this civil society network.
The network is an association of civil society organisations and individuals that has been working since 2011 to promote open government and administrative action as a holistic approach to strengthening democracy. In particular, the focus is on the exchange with the Federal Government and the development of national action plans.</description>

      <description>Code For Germany is a network of groups of volunteers (labs) who use their skills to shape their cities and social life. They advocate more transparency, open data and participation in their cities. In particular, they mediate between civil society, administration and politics, and use their skills to improve communication between them. This provides the necessary impetus so that as many people as possible can benefit from open and free digitisation.</description>

      <description>In a democracy, it is necessary for citizens to be able to inform themselves freely about government actions. With the Freedom of Information Act, every person, regardless of age or origin, has the right to request documents from the authorities. The FragDenStaat online platform supports citizens in exercising their right to access information from German authorities. Citizens no longer have to work their way through the legal jungle of the federal states and the federal government to make a request.</description>

      <description>Coding da Vinci is the first cultural data hackathon in Germany that brings together cultural heritage institutions and the hacker/designer community to develop ideas and prototypes for both the cultural sector and the public. More and more galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs) are digitalising their collections to make them accessible online and to preserve our heritage for future generations. Only when cultural data is made openly available (according to the Open Definition) can it serve as the creative basis for innovative new applications and projects.</description>

      <guid>https://okfn.de/en/projekte/datenmachenschule/</guid>
      <description>DatenmachenSchule shows the potential open data in the classroom. The initial idea for the project came from a study published in 2013 on the subject of Open Data by the Fraunhofer Focus Institute:
&amp;ldquo;Open administrative data [&amp;hellip;] in principle holds the chance of a new educational design (Open Educational Resources)&amp;rdquo;.
In order to pursue this thesis, a cooperation between the administration of the city of Moers, the Gymnasium Adolfinum, the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences and the Open Knowledge Lab Niederrhein was formed.</description>

      <description>How can we empower children and young adults today to become the shapers of tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s society? What makes young adults more visible as actors? What role do digital technologies play here? And how can participation succeed on both the digital and social levels?
In order to answer these and other questions, we have developed various workshop formats and materials with the democracy labs in order to help a broad target group of children and young adults to experience self-efficacy in the field of democracy and technology.</description>

      <description>The allocation of funds through public procurement (services, bulding contracts, and goods) represents a significant share of state expenditure. In the EU, this amounts to about 16% of the GDP. In many cases, the allocation of these contracts is not conducted transparently. As a result, 20-25% of the total number of orders can be lost to corruption.
In order to change this, we are working together with five partners on the EU project, DIGIWHIST.</description>

      <description>Energyhack is a hackathon around open energy data. Our energy supply and the ways of its generation are manifold. But how is energy distributed and how do we ensure that more information can be exchanged between producers and consumers? Together with developers, designers, and researchers, thought leaders in the energy industry brainstorm ideas, design, and develop prototypes in 24 hours. The data from the Open Data Portal Netzdaten-Berlin was available to the participants as a database.</description>

      <description>The shaping of family life in Germany has changed enormously in recent decades. Patchwork families, multi-generation houses and households of single parents bring completely different requirements with them. One of the biggest challenges is the compatibility of family and career. Or to put it another way: is it really necessary to have to sit in a doctor&amp;rsquo;s waiting room for three hours each time? We think that this can work better.</description>

      <description>https.jetzt! shows how many government websites support encryption via HTTPS. Why is website encryption important?
Any unencrypted transmission of data can be intercepted on the Internet and thus manipulated. Therefore, it is obvious that any transmission of sensitive data, such as orders in online shops, online banking, or logins to websites with non-public content should always be encrypted. For the user this means: when in doubt you should always check in your browser whether an encrypted transmission is displayed there.</description>

      <description>The right to ask questions is an important right of MPs - and a frequently used parliamentary control instrument. In the German parliament alone, thousands of so-called &amp;ldquo;small questions&amp;rdquo; are asked in each parliamentary term, which must be answered in writing by the government. If you add the questions asked in the parliaments of the federal states, a huge pool of useful information results which is scattered throughout the various online archives.</description>

      <description>The goal of Offene Daten was to create the prototype of a data portal for openly accessible administrative data that had not been available in Germany before. Offenedaten.de was used as a data catalogue for the Apps 4 Germany competition, which took place in 2011. In this competition, 77 innovative applications for citizens were developed from 320 data sets and 112 ideas.
From 2014, the beta version of the portal will also contain the total metadata of the Open Data Monitor project.</description>

      <description>The central task of a parliament is to draw up and debate a budget. This essential political process decides which activities the state can carry out and which services cannot be provided. Budget data must be published by law. Unfortunately, budget data format is not standardised, which means that booklets with more than 1000 pages are printed and slowly deteriorate in the town hall or placed as PDF files on the corresponding websites.</description>

      <description>The corporate registry is the public repository of companies, foundations and associations in Germany. It contains data about legal status, address and officers of an entity.
This data is important for trust in business and the people involved. However, this data is not made openly accessible by the government.
Together with OpenCorporates we published the German corporate registry as open data for the first time.  Picture: Hamburg. Speicherstadt von Max Stolbinsky under CC BY 2.</description>

      <description>Many municipalities, counties and regions in Germany have council information systems at their disposal in order to organise committee work in local councils and at district assemblies. A lot of information is hidden in these council information systems of German municipalities. The entire municipal policy is documented - decisions that have a direct impact on the inhabitants of the city. Nonetheless, to involve citizens and their creative potential in the city&amp;rsquo;s politics, it is important to provide information.</description>

      <description>OpenBudgets was an EU Horizon 2020 funded project that aims to make government budget data more accessible in a centralized and transparent way. On the basis of an open source framework, a Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) portal will be created through which stakeholders (e.g. journalists, members of parliament, citizens, NGOs) can find and export budget data and present it with the help of a visualization library. The project seeks to open up new possibilities for comparison and analysis in order to enable greater transparency.</description>

      <description>Your application for a mortgage is declined, you cannot get a mobile phone contract, and even with your apartment searches you constantly lose out. Why is that? The SCHUFA, of course! Really? Does SCHUFA disadvantage one group of people compared to another? Does it reinforce injustices? This is what we want to find out with OpenSCHUFA.
The SCHUFA score tries to summarise the financial trustworthiness of a person in a few numbers - the scores.</description>

      <description>The open council information system &amp;ldquo;Politik Bei Uns&amp;rdquo; presents information and processes from council and administration in a user-friendly way, so that citizens can understand political decisions and can have a say at an early stage. As a data market place, our project makes council and administrative data available to third-party developers so that they can build further applications without much effort. Apart from politics, civil society and journalists, the scientific community also benefits from structured and therefore analysable data.</description>

      <description>Refugeephrasebook.de organises volunteer translations and distributes useful information for refugees and their helpers. Together with partner institutions in Germany, Greece and the Netherlands, the refugee phrasebook team develops sustainable communication tools to share phrases, icons and other helpful resources. All materials are adaptable for local needs and distributed with open licences to foster communication between refugees, citizens and helpers all over Europe. Our goal is to empower refugees all across Europe to communicate and voice their needs, independently of network access and battery life, even if they can only stay in a country for a limited time.</description>

      <description>After the campaign #FragDenBundestag by FragDenStaat and Abgeordnetenwatch, the German parliament decided to publish all reports of its scientific service online. In the three weeks leading up to that decision, thousands of users have requested expert opinions via FragDenBundestag.de, which the German parliament has to publish according to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
However, the documents have not been prepared - the list is unclear and not searchable. That is why there is sehrGutachten: a platform that presents the reports in a structured way to make them searchable in full text.</description>

      <description>With the project &amp;ldquo;Stadt Land Code&amp;rdquo; we wanted to encourage developers to create useful digital applications for the public space. These applications were meant to serve as the foundation for participatory mechanisms and increased transparency in public administration.
Examples for such applications include www.fixmystreet.com and www.everyblock.com. We supported developer teams with stipends and invited them to a camp with workshops in Berlin.</description>

      <description>According to Article 5 of the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz), every person has the right to obtain free information from generally accessible sources. That sounds promising at first. But for a long time there was a lack of generally accessible sources. It was not until the turn of the millennium that many German states took a big step: freedom of information was the order of the day. Through freedom of information laws, the first state parliaments in Berlin and Brandenburg obliged local administrations and state authorities to renounce the previously valid official secrecy.</description>

      <description>In the Berlin coalition agreement, the governing parties agreed to further develop the Berlin Freedom of Information Act into a transparency law. However, a concrete draft has not yet been worked out. We want to change that. Together with civil society partners, we have written a draft for a Berlin Transparency Act. Within the framework of a referendum, we will implement the draft law for the whole of Berlin by 2021.</description>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;Wahl.Daten.Helfer.&amp;rdquo; was originally a platform on which hackathons can be announced for elections. We not only wanted to deal with current election data, but also develop toolkits and apps for upcoming elections, which can be easily adapted and used for example for the European elections.
The project was continued as a community project with an extended focus. The Wahl.Daten.Helfer now helps you to inform yourself about parties and their programs.</description>

      <description>Museums, archives, libraries and momuments are operated and maintained with public funds. The international conference &amp;ldquo;Zugang gestalten&amp;rdquo; asks the question whether this is adequately reflected in the level of access to the cultural treasures that these institutions possess and maintain. The conference invites key figures in culture, science, civic society and politics to publicly explore different ways of accessing digital cultural heritage in Germany.
&amp;ldquo;Zugang gestalten&amp;rdquo; stands under the auspices of the German UNESCO commission and is a collaboartive project of the Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland, Stiftung Historische Museen Hamburg, Servicestelle Digitalisierung Berlin, Deutschen Digitalen Bibliothek, Internet &amp;amp; Gesellschaft Collaboratory, Institut Français Deutschland, iRights.</description>
