    <summary>&lt;p&gt;After the successful first Bits &amp;amp; Bäume Conference in 2018, the topics of digitalization and sustainability are more present in our society today than ever before. We are facing major societal and global challenges for a just and sustainable shaping of our (surrounding) world. Therefore, we would like to broaden and consolidate the networking of environmental and justice activists, technology experts and human rights activists with the &lt;strong&gt;Bits &amp;amp; Bäume 2022 conference from September 30 to October 2, 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; This also includes networking our communities with representatives of social-ecological small digital businesses and founders as well as politicians in order to find concrete solutions for the pressing issues of our time. We want to discuss major political strategies and governance proposals, but also learn from each other through best practice examples how we can realize climate and environmental protection, social justice, democracy and fundamental rights in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Open Government Network, we support Germany&amp;rsquo;s active participation in the Open Government Partnership (OGP) and the interests of German civil society in this process, as well as help coordinate this civil society network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network is an association of civil society organisations and individuals that has been working since 2011 to promote open government and administrative action as a holistic approach to strengthening democracy. In particular, the focus is on the exchange with the Federal Government and the development of national action plans.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;The Turing Bus is a mobile educational project for schools and youth clubs in rural areas. The bus brings representatives of Fablabs, OK-Labs and Hackspaces as well as experts in digital topics to often underserved places of youth education. Its goal is to generate an exchange of knowledge and experiences through workshops, discussions, screenings, and more. The project is funded in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wissenschaftsjahr.de&#34;&gt;Science Year&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bmbf.de&#34;&gt;BMBF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bus wants to explore, discuss, and critically question the role of digitisation and technology in the professional landscape and society as a whole. It engages young adults between the ages of 15 and 20 with workshops, lectures, as well as hands-on sessions.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Code For Germany is a network of groups of volunteers (labs) who use their skills to shape their cities and social life. They advocate more transparency, open data and participation in their cities. In particular, they mediate between civil society, administration and politics, and use their skills to improve communication between them. This provides the necessary impetus so that as many people as possible can benefit from open and free digitisation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;In a democracy, it is necessary for citizens to be able to inform themselves freely about government actions. With the Freedom of Information Act, every person, regardless of age or origin, has the right to request documents from the authorities. The FragDenStaat online platform supports citizens in exercising their right to access information from German authorities. Citizens no longer have to work their way through the legal jungle of the federal states and the federal government to make a request. Questions and answers transparently appear online. The number of requests for information in Germany already doubled in the year this project was founded.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;With the Prototype Fund, we support socially relevant software projects and increase their sustainable impact through open source by principle. In short: We fund open source software made by society and for society.
We make digital social innovation possible with developers who bring a wide range of skills to technology design and are given the space to develop their good ideas. You will receive funding of up to €95,000 over six months or €158,000 over ten months for your project and team. The fund supports software developers, hackers, and creative minds in turning sketches for tools and applications into reality. The Prototype Fund has redefinied its funding priorities since 2025 and now focuses on the areas of data security and software infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

We mainly target non-profit organisations that work with data, or alternatively want to deepen their existing data knowledge. Within a cooperation period of about three months, we developed practice-oriented workshops and individualized technical training courses with our partners and trainers to support social projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want non-profit organisations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;Jugend hackt is a program for young people who want to improve the world with their technical skills. Supported by volunteer mentors, our participants develop digital tools, prototypes and concepts for a better future. Our offer includes hackathon events in many cities, regional labs, an online community and international exchange programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with our motto &amp;ldquo;Improve the world with code&amp;rdquo;, Jugend hackt is about more than just learning to program: We understand technology as a means of social change. We encourage young people to use technology responsibly in order to find solutions to socio-political questions. They create projects such as a watering system that donates free WiFi; a bracelet that warns of surveillance cameras or an audio computer game for people with visual impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;2030Watch monitors the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Germany.
The SDGs were set by the United Nations in September 2015 and will be implemented by 2030.
All members of the United Nations have committed to realising these 17 goals and 169 targets.
The goals include the eradication of poverty and inequality between and within countries, as well as action against climate change.
2030Watch primarily uses data from the OECD, the World Bank and other international organisations.
The project will also propose indicators for goals which are hard to operationalize, such as fair trade relations.
The launch of the 2030 Watch website is planned for the end of October 2015.
The project budget for 2015 is 55.620 Euro.
73% of the budget is funded by the German ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The other funders are Welthungerhilfe (9%), Brot für die Welt/EED (9%) and Terre des Hommes (7%).
The remaining funds are private donations (below 1%).&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

Our goal is to put the common good at the heart of digital policy and ensure the future of a democratic digital society. That&#39;s why we pool our expertise in the various topic areas of digitization.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Apps and the City&amp;rdquo; was a hackday on local traffic organised by Open Knowledge Foundation Germany together with the local transport provider VBB, the Berlin government, and the FH Potsdam.
The VBB released GTFS data, opened up their API and provided some geo datasets about entrances to stations.
During the event, coders, software experts, and designers used open transport data to create applications intended to improve public transport non-commercially.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
