      <description>Personnel costs are by far the largest expense item. Our excellent team is our most important resource. In addition, material costs as well as tax payments are incurred every year. Most of the expenditure is project-related. The administrative costs include, for example, costs for rent, finances, insurances and technical infrastructure.</description>

      <description>The majority (69%) of our income comes from project-related grants. In addition, there is growing donation income amounting to approximately 29% of our income. Most of the donations are addressed to FragDenStaat. Additionally, Jugend hackt, Code for Germany and OKF DE as a whole record donations. Furthermore, we generated about 2% of our income from economic income sources. Sponsoring currently accounts for less than 1% of our funds.
