      <description>Most of our spendings are linked to the implementation of projects and the organisation of events. We try to keep fixed costs (non project-related expenditure) low. Rent, ancillary costs for the Berlin office and server expenses represent the majority of such costs.
 ** for example infrastructure, book keeping, insurances
On average, we currently employ 36 people, but not all of them are full-time staff.</description>
