      <description>Personnel costs are by far the largest expense item. Our excellent team is our most important resource. In addition, non-personnel costs as well as tax payments are incurred every year. Most of the expenditure is project-related. We try to keep the administrative costs of the organization low. They include, for example, material costs for rent, finances, insurances and technical infrastructure.</description>

      <description>The majority (60%) of our income comes from project-related grants. In addition, there is growing donation income amounting to approximately 37% of our income. Most of the donations are addressed to FragDenStaat. Additionally, Jugend hackt, Code for Germany and OKF DE as a whole record donations. Furthermore, we generated about 2% of our income from economic income sources. Sponsoring currently accounts for less than 1% of our funds.
