    <summary>Personnel costs are by far the largest expense item. Our excellent team is our most important resource. In addition, non-personnel costs as well as tax payments are incurred every year. Most of the expenditure is project-related. We try to keep the administrative costs of the organization low. They include, for example, material costs for rent, finances, insurances and technical infrastructure.</summary>
