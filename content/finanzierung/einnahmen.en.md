About half (54%) of our income comes from project-related grants. In addition, we receive donations (40% of our income). Most of the donations are addressed to FragDenStaat but also Jugend hackt, Code for Germany and OKF DE as a whole record donations. Only 6% of our income derives from economic income sources, including some minor sponsoring income.  Other income includes minor interest income for the first time.
