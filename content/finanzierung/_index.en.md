Since our launch in 2011, our funding is based on project work. Our projects are financed by a variety of changing private and public funding institutions. In addition, we generate income via donations and to a small degree via economic activities. In the financial year 2021, we raised more than 2.504 million euros for our work. This was offset by total expenditure of 2.164 million euros.
