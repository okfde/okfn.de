Since our launch in 2011, our funding is based on project work. Our projects are financed by a variety of changing private and public funding institutions. In addition, we generate income via donations and to a small degree via economic activities. In the financial year 2024, we raised 3.742 million euros for our work. This was offset by total expenditure of 2.959 million euros.
