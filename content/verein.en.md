### Association and umbrella organisation

We are committed to the dissemination of free and openly accessible knowledge in society. We see ourselves as an active part of German and European civil society. Our work is independent, non-partisan, interdisciplinary, and non-commercial.

We are present in numerous areas of society and are recognized as one of the leading organisations for innovative projects in the areas of transparency and accountability, rule of law, access to knowledge and participation, digital literacy and public control in Germany and Europe alike.

We are also the German branch of the globally active [Open Knowledge Network](https://okfn.org/network/).
