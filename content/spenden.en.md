### Donations enable our work to remain independent, non-partisan, interdisciplinary and non-commercial.

With our [current notice of exemption](https://okfn.de/files/documents/2023_Freistellungsbescheid_fuer2022.pdf) we are recognised as a non-profit association for the promotion of science and research as well as of popular and vocational education. For donations up to 300 Euro per year your proof of payment (e.g. bank statement) together with our [Vereinfachten Zuwendungsnachweis](https://okfn.de/files/documents/2023_OKF_Zuwendungen_vereinfachteZuwendungsbest.pdf) is sufficient as proof of donation.

Donations enable our work to remain independent, non-partisan, interdisciplinary, and non-commercial.

We depend on your support:

* to carry out political campaign work in the interests of civil society
* to support open knowledge and digital literacy projects
* to pay for the infrastructure that supports all our projects (internal administration, material and rental costs).
