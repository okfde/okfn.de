### Donations enable our work to remain independent, non-partisan, interdisciplinary and non-commercial. If our mission is close to your heart and your financial situation allows it, you can secure our work in the long term.

With your support, you are strengthening a strong digital civil society and enabling us:

* to do political campaigning in the interests of civil society
* to carry out projects on free knowledge and digital literacy
* to pay for our mission-critical infrastructure that supports all our projects (e. g. servers, administration and ongoing rental costs)

With our [current notice of exemption](https://okfn.de/files/documents/2023_Freistellungsbescheid_fuer2022.pdf) we are recognised as a non-profit association for the promotion of science and research as well as of popular and vocational education. For donations up to 300 Euro per year your proof of payment (e.g. bank statement) together with our [Vereinfachten Zuwendungsnachweis](https://okfn.de/files/documents/2023_OKF_Zuwendungen_vereinfachteZuwendungsbest.pdf) is sufficient as proof of donation.

Inheritances are a special opportunity to leave a positive impact. If you are now asking yourself: *Inheritance, but how?* take a look at our [blog post](https://okfn.de/blog/2024/09/spenden-und-erbschaften-f%C3%BCr-die-okf/). Thank you for your support!
