### Internal ethics officer

Since 2017, we have had the office of ethics officer in the team. The ethics officer is the first point of contact for internal and external ethical questions. In addition, the ethics officer is the first point of contact for team members who have concerns and uncertainties of any kind. The ethics officer ensures that requests are forwarded to the right places (e.g. board or director) and supervises the process. The current ethics officer is Sonja Fischbauer.

### Whistleblowing Policy

OKF has joined a civil society alliance to introduce a [Whistleblowing Policy](https://freiheitsrechte.org/uploads/documents/Demokratie/Policy_Whistleblowing-2022-Gesellschaft-fuer-Freiheitsrechte-Zivilcourage-Demokratie.pdf). With the Whistleblowing Policy, we are committed to protecting people who report significant misconduct in our organization. We have established a joint internal reporting office with the participating organizations to which whistleblowers can turn. The reporting office can be reached via: https://www.vertrauensanwalt.org/. You can find further information in our [OKF Code of Procedure](/files/documents/OKF_WhistleblowingPolicy_Verfahrensordnung.pdf) (only in German).
