Since February 19, 2011, we have been advocating open knowledge as well as digital literacy and the ethical use of technology, demonstrating its democratic potential and bringing people together. On this day, the Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland e.V. was founded in Berlin.

Since then, we have implemented 56 projects, drunk (circa) 4700 bottles of mate, and made 55797 commits to our GitHub repository. OK Labs have been founded in 26 cities and our community has grown to a staggering 1387 members, who have contributed decisively to the success of numerous projects and thus to OKF.  

To celebrate our 10th anniversary, we're taking a look back at what we've accomplished over the past few years. We will talk to our early supporters, companions, friends and sponsors and take you on a journey through the first ten years of OKF in Germany in interviews, blogposts and videos.
