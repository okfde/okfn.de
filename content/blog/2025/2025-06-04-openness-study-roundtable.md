## Invitation

The idea of openness has had a decisive influence on the digital age. Whether open source software, open standards or freely licensed content ‚Äî many foundations are based on principles of accessibility, participation and transparency. Openness, understood as free access, free use, modification and sharing of knowledge, has established itself as a driver of innovation and social progress. However, despite all its successes, the concept of openness seems to be going through a crisis. Between political appropriation, economic instrumentalisation and technological upheaval, the concept of openness is coming under increasing pressure and threatens to become diluted. The reasons for this include contradictory definitions, the enormous concentration of power in a few tech companies, geopolitical tensions and internal conflicts in openness communities.

The new study [From Software to Society: Openness in a changing world](https://okfn.de/blog/2025/05/from-software-to-society-openness-in-a-changing-world/) by Dr. Henriette Litta and Peter Bihr takes stock and looks to the future: What does openness mean in the digital age? Is the concept still up to date? The study traces the development of openness and analyses current challenges. It is based on interviews with experts and extensive literature research. 

In this conversation, we will bring together senior members of the Open Knowledge Network from different continents and contexts to discuss the findings and recommendations of the study. Does the concept of openness have the same meaning everywhere? Can we learn lessons from local practices in defending openness and the digital commons?
