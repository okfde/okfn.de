How can we make governments more transparent and accountable? What are tried and true strategies for opening up government data? The annual OGP summit is an opportunity for the open government community to address its current issues and challenges, and discuss the way ahead. This year, the summit will be held in December in Paris, and you can have your say in shaping the agenda. Together with our friends and partners like [g0v.tw](http://g0v.asia/tw/), [Open Contracting Partnership](http://www.open-contracting.org) and [Transparency International](www.transparency.org), we are involved in a couple of sessions -  all of which are listed below. **Your vote would count towards them happening!**

*Factors of Success and Failure for Public Procurement Portals* <br />
This roundtable will focus on public procurement portals and the ways civil society and government actors can collaborate to make these portals more open and transparent, integrate feedback loops, as well as generate lessons for the rapidly expanding community of such portals about the critical elements of lasting impact. <br /> Find out more and vote [here](https://en.ogpsummit.org/osem/conference/ogp-summit/program/proposal/193)!</li>

<li>[Tools to track corruption and engage stakeholders in public contracting](https://en.ogpsummit.org/osem/conference/ogp-summit/program/proposal/248)<br />
More than 50 countries in the Open Government Partnership have committed to making their procurement more transparent. At least 15 countries are implementing and starting to publish in the Open Contracting Data Standard. This increased access to open data on government contracts means new opportunities to analyze, monitor and use this data to shine a light on public procurement markets - notorious havens for corruption. This interactive session will focus on sharing approaches to creating effective and re-usable mechanisms and platforms for government, business, and civic activists with a focus on corruption risks and government effectiveness.<br />
