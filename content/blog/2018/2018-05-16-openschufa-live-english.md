Let's go! Today we launch the [data donation platform for our crowdsourcing project OpenSCHUFA](https://www.openschufa.de). At [openschufa.de](https://www.openschufa.de) all people can upload the data they requested from the SCHUFA. We will then analyze them together with our partner AlgorithmWatch to crack the SCHUFA algorithm.

More than 20,000 people have already applied for their free self-disclosure since the beginning of our campaign via [selbstauskunft.net/schufa](https://selbstauskunft.net/schufa).
