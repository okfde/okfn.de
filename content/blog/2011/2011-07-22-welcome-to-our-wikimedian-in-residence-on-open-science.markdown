title: Welcome to our Wikimedian in Residence on Open Science
type: post

Our work at the Open Knowledge Foundation, both in Germany and globally, often involves catalyzing the interactions between communities from diverse backgrounds that share a common goal. For example, the upcoming [Open Aid Data Konferenz](/blog/2011/07/open-aid-data-konferenz/) brings together communities working on and with Open Data, in and with the developing world, and on transparent governance.

Now, we are happy to announce that - thanks to a grant from the [Open Society Foundations](http://www.soros.org/openaccess) - we can **welcome Daniel Mietchen as a Wikimedian in Residence on Open Science** (see also [the Wikimedia blog](http://blog.wikimedia.org/2011/07/20/joining-forces-with-open-science/)), so as to stimulate interactions between the wiki, Open Knowledge, Open Access and Open Science communities.



 Bollen, J.; H. Van De Sompel & A. Hagberg et al. (2009), "[Clickstream Data Yields High-Resolution Maps of Science](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004803)", _PLoS ONE_ **4** (3), [DOI](http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier):[10.1371/journal.pone.0004803](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0004803), Figure 5.

Matters of Open Science have always featured prominently in our activities: for example, we were involved in the drafting of the [Panton Principles](http://pantonprinciples.org/) for the sharing of scientific data, and we ran an [Open Science and Social Science Workshop](http://science.okfn.org/2011/07/01/pre-okcon-open-science-and-social-science-workshop/) prior to [OKCon](http://okcon.org/2011/). The conference itself was organized in partnership with [Wikimedia Germany](http://wikimedia.de/) and featured, amongst lots of other contributions, a sequence of sessions on [Wikipedia & Research](http://okcon.org/2011/programme/wikipedia-research-the-innovative-character-of-wikipedia-research-and-the-new-challenges-and-opportunities-associated-with-it), [Open Research](http://okcon.org/2011/programme/collaborative-platforms-for-streamlining-workflows-in-open-science), [Collaborative platforms for Open Science](http://okcon.org/2011/programme/collaborative-platforms-for-streamlining-workflows-in-open-science), the [Wikimedia Toolserver](http://okcon.org/2011/programme/wikimedia-toolserver), [Reforming Scholarly Publishing](http://okcon.org/2011/programme/scholarly-publishing-reform-what-needs-to-change) and [Citing versioned sources](http://okcon.org/2011/programme/citing-versioned-sources).

Daniel - who studied biophysics at [Humboldt University](http://www2.hu-berlin.de/biologie/bpi/) and sings in a [band](http://tschiltan.de/) here in Berlin - was involved in several of these activities, and the new project provides him with a great opportunity to engage with these matters and to highlight the values of both wiki-based collaboration and Open Access to scientific information. He has set up a [new blog](http://wir.okfn.org/2011/07/14/a-wiki-approach-to-open-access-and-open-science/) along with a [wiki home](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedian_in_Residence_on_Open_Science) for the project and can be reached on Twitter via [@EvoMRI](http://twitter.com/EvoMRI).

There are multiple ways in which you can [get involved](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Mietchen/Wikimedian_in_Residence_on_Open_Science#Get_involved), the gist being that if you are contributing to a Wikimedia project, the project can help you find reusable materials from Open Access and Open Science sources, and if you are involved in creating or managing [open](http://www.opendefinition.org/) resources elsewhere, the project may help you reach a wider audience for your work. There are also opportunities for developers, illustrators, translators, reviewers and others - please get in touch if any of these is you.
