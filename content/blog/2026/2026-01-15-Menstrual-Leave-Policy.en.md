**[taz](https://taz.de/Geschlechtergerechte-Arbeitswelt/!6143993/) newspaper reported on OKF: In many countries and companies, there is a debate about whether menstrual pain and cycle-related discomfort should be recognised as grounds for additional days off as part of a gender-equitable working environment.** Such regulations exist in some countries by law (e.g. in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) and voluntarily in many companies. **We have had this model in place since 2021, anchored in our Menstrual Leave Policy. We spoke to Sonja Fischbauer, our organisational developer, about it.**

## Dear Sonja, how long has there been a Menstrual Leave Policy in our organisation and why did we introduce it?

At OKF, we introduced a menstrual leave policy five years ago to recognise and destigmatise menstrual-related discomfort. Pain associated with menstruation has historically often been dismissed as something you just have to put up with. Even though conditions such as endometriosis are very common, they are relatively poorly researched. As an organisation, we want to send a message with this policy: that you don't just have to endure pain caused by menstruation, and that we as an organisation are committed to equality in health.

## How exactly does the policy work?

The process for menstrual leave is the same as for regular sick leave: no medical certificate is required for the first two days, but from the third day onwards, a medical certificate is required. No one has to state the reason for their sick leave. However, discussion within the team or in smaller groups is expressly welcome if there is a need.

## What has been your experience with it so far?
The feedback has been consistently positive. We mention the menstrual leave policy in our job advertisements and always receive good feedback. For many people, the policy is a socio-political signal that contributes to their enjoyment of working here and their sense of well-being. There are always interested enquiries, including from outside the company, as the interview with [taz](https://taz.de/Geschlechtergerechte-Arbeitswelt/!6143993/) shows. The policy has been seamlessly integrated into everyday life for five years and is unspectacular in the most positive sense.

## Some people criticise menstrual leave policies, saying that they could have a stigmatising effect or reinforce discrimination. How would you respond to these people?

The menstrual leave policy does not mean that you are automatically ill because of menstruation. The policy explicitly states that if you are unable to work due to menstrual*discomfort*, this is a legitimate reason to report sick. Just as anyone can report sick if they have physical or mental health issues. No one has to talk about the reason for their illness. But as an organisation, we want to create a space that takes all aspects of our employees' physical and mental health seriously. In our experience, open communication and a relaxed, inclusive attitude help to reduce stigma.

Our Menstrual Leave Policy is part of our principle of [activism from within](https://okfn.de/publikationen/aktivismusvoninnen/): we combine this with the aspiration to not only represent our social demands externally, but also to implement them within our team. The values we desire in society should also be reflected in our internal structures and everyday work. Through our projects, we work on social justice and participation on many levels – this also includes looking at the conditions within our organisation. This is reflected in the way we treat our employees and in the way we manage human resources. In this way, we want to contribute to fair and equal working conditions.
