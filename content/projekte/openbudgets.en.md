OpenBudgets was an EU Horizon 2020 funded project that aims to make government budget data more accessible in a centralized and transparent way. On the basis of an open source framework, a Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) portal will be created through which stakeholders (e.g. journalists, members of parliament, citizens, NGOs) can find and export budget data and present it with the help of a visualization library. The project seeks to open up new possibilities for comparison and analysis in order to enable greater transparency and to more effectively fight corruption in public finance.
