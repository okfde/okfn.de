After the campaign [ #FragDenBundestag](https://netzpolitik.org/2016/frag-den-bundestag-4000-gutachten-warten-darauf-befreit-zu-werden/) by FragDenStaat and Abgeordnetenwatch, the Bundestag decided to publish the reports of its scientific service online. In the last three weeks, thousands of users have requested expert opinions via FragDenBundestag.de, which the Bundestag has to publish according to the Freedom of Information Act (IFG).

However, the documents have not been prepared - the list is unclear and not searchable. That is why there are very expert opinions: On this page we present the reports in a structured way and make them searchable in full text. This results in various possibilities: The reports on topics such as security policy, finance, criminal law, asylum law and European policy are now available for scientific analysis, journalists and civil society actors. Users can obtain information about uploaded reports via feed and developers can obtain data about the reports in JSON format.
