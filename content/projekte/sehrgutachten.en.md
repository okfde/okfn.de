After the campaign [ #FragDenBundestag](https://netzpolitik.org/2016/frag-den-bundestag-4000-gutachten-warten-darauf-befreit-zu-werden/) by FragDenStaat and Abgeordnetenwatch, the German parliament decided to publish all reports of its scientific service online. In the three weeks leading up to that decision, thousands of users have requested expert opinions via FragDenBundestag.de, which the German parliament has to publish according to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

However, the documents have not been prepared - the list is unclear and not searchable. That is why there is sehrGutachten: a platform that presents the reports in a structured way to make them searchable in full text. This enables a number of possibilities: reports on topics such as security policy, finance, criminal law, asylum law and European policy are now available for scientific analysis, journalists, and civil society actors. Readers can obtain information about uploaded reports via feed, and developers can obtain data about the reports in JSON format.
