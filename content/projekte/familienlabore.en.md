The shaping of family life in Germany has changed enormously in recent decades. Patchwork families, multi-generation houses and households of single parents bring completely different requirements with them. One of the biggest challenges is and remains the compatibility of family and career. Or to put it another way: Is it really necessary to have to sit in a doctor's waiting room for three hours each time? We think: this works better.

The FamilyLabs are a workshop format to think together with family members, local stakeholders and technology experts about the better compatibility of family and career and to develop concrete, prototypical solutions. This can be the waiting room app. Or making regional data on education and leisure opportunities accessible to people who are not interested in technology. Or an exchange platform to find Wahlomas and Wahlopas. Or a digital open source tool for better shopping coordination within families. Everything that burns under the nails of the participants in the family labs and for which there are technical solutions. In the form of crazy workshop formats with comics, mini robots, click/paper prototypes and photo novestories everything becomes possible!
