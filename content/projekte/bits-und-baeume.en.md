After the successful first Bits & Bäume Conference in 2018, the topics of digitalization and sustainability are more present in our society today than ever before. We are facing major societal and global challenges for a just and sustainable shaping of our (surrounding) world. Therefore, we would like to broaden and consolidate the networking of environmental and justice activists, technology experts and human rights activists with the **Bits & Bäume 2022 conference from September 30 to October 2, 2022.** This also includes networking our communities with representatives of social-ecological small digital businesses and founders as well as politicians in order to find concrete solutions for the pressing issues of our time. We want to discuss major political strategies and governance proposals, but also learn from each other through best practice examples how we can realize climate and environmental protection, social justice, democracy and fundamental rights in the digital age. 

Together we want to discuss on panels, in workshops and open spaces:   
 
* How can digitalization be designed to contribute to a sustainable transformation of society?

* What does a globally, economically, socially and ecologically just future look like in the digitized world?

* What can the tech community (bits) and the justice and environmental movement (trees) learn from each other? And how can we become politically active, also together with progressive and alternative-economic actors?

**The Bits & Bäume Conference 2022 is organized by a supporting/sponsoring committee, a conference office and many dedicated volunteers. The following organizations are represented in the sponsoring committee:**

Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland (BUND), Brot für die Welt, Chaos Computer Club (CCC), Deutscher Naturschutz Ring (DNR), Einstein Center Digital Future / Technische Universität Berlin, Forum InformatikerInnen für Frieden und gesellschaftliche Verantwortung e. V. (FIfF), Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), Germanwatch e.V., Institut für ökologische Wirtschaftsforschung (IÖW), Konzeptwerk Neue Ökonomie, Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland e. V. (OKF), Weizenbaum Institut e.V., Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft (ver.di)
