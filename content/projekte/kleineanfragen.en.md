The right to ask questions is an important right of MEPs - and a frequently used parliamentary control instrument. In the Bundestag alone, thousands of small questions are asked in each parliamentary term, which must be answered in writing by the government. If you add the questions asked in the parliaments of the Länder, a huge pool of useful information results which is scattered throughout the various online archives. On kleineanfragen.de we collect and bundle these documents and make them - as a contribution to transparency and participation - more easily accessible for the public.
