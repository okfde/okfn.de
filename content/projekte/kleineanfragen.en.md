The right to ask questions is an important right of MPs - and a frequently used parliamentary control instrument. In the German parliament alone, thousands of so-called "small questions" are asked in each parliamentary term, which must be answered in writing by the government. If you add the questions asked in the parliaments of the federal states, a huge pool of useful information results which is scattered throughout the various online archives. On kleineanfragen.de we collect and bundle these documents and make them - as a contribution to transparency and participation - more easily accessible for the public.
