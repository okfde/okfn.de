subtitle: Germany becomes sustainable
---

2030Watch monitors the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Germany.
The SDGs were set by the United Nations in September 2015 and will be implemented by 2030.
All members of the United Nations have committed to realising these 17 goals and 169 targets.
The goals include the eradication of poverty and inequality between and within countries, as well as action against climate change.
2030Watch primarily uses data from the OECD, the World Bank and other international organisations.
The project will also propose indicators for goals which are hard to operationalize, such as fair trade relations.
The launch of the 2030 Watch website is planned for the end of October 2015.
The project budget for 2015 is 55.620 Euro.
73% of the budget is funded by the German ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The other funders are Welthungerhilfe (9%), Brot f√ºr die Welt/EED (9%) and Terre des Hommes (7%).
The remaining funds are private donations (below 1%).
