offenedaten.de is the prototype of a CKAN-based open data catalogue for various types of public, scientific, economic and administrative data. It was initiated by citizens in 2010 and is now run by the Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland. Since 2014 it contains all of the meta data accumulated by the project Open Data Monitor.

The goal of offenedaten.de is to provide a central resource for as many open data sources as possible in order to faciilitate structured and easy access with geographical and user-friendly categorizations. It primarily addresses students, scientists, journalists, and developers. The geographical claissification of data sources was one of the main achievements of offenedaten.de.
