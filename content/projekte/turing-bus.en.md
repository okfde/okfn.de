The Turing Bus is a mobile educational project for schools and youth clubs in rural areas. The bus brings representatives of Fablabs, OK-Labs and Hackspaces as well as experts in digital topics to often underserved places of youth education. Its goal is to generate an exchange of knowledge and experiences through workshops, discussions, screenings, and more. The project is funded in the <a href="https://wissenschaftsjahr.de">Science Year</a> of the <a href="https://bmbf.de">BMBF</a>.

The Bus wants to explore, discuss, and critically question the role of digitisation and technology in the professional landscape and society as a whole. It engages young adults between the ages of 15 and 20 with workshops, lectures, as well as hands-on sessions.
