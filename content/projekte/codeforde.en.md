Code for Germany is a network of volunteers dedicated to a digital future that serves the common good. The network comprises approximately 300 community members in Germany and beyond. They examine the state of digitalization in their cities, municipalities, and regions. They develop helpful software and hardware projects. They analyze current technological developments for their societal benefits. They demonstrate the value of open data and advocate for the sustainable digitalization of public administration.

Code for Germany has around 20 regional groups that meet regularly in local OK Labs, short for Open Knowledge Labs.

The Open Knowledge Foundation Germany provides the legal framework and IT infrastructure for the otherwise self-governing network. Individual community members decide for themselves what they work on and how they organize themselves.
