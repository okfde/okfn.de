Code for Germany is a network of volunteers working on sustainable digital projects for an open and fair society. The central theme is how data, information and knowledge can be processed in such a way that they are accessible to as many people as possible. This strengthens citizens' participation in democratic processes and makes their everyday lives easier. To make this possible, volunteers meet regularly in their cities in Open Knowledge Labs (OK Labs). They discuss open government strategies and develop digital solutions to problems and needs they have identified in their cities and neighbourhoods.

Some cities already have Open Data programs and make data sets available openly, but in many cases there is still a lack of applications and examples that demonstrate the practical use of open data - this is exactly where Code for Germany comes into play. In addition to software projects, "Do It Yourself" hardware projects such as the network of fine dust sensors or the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWan) are also being worked on.

The program started in February 2014 with the foundation of Open Knowledge Labs in 8 cities. In the meantime, the network has grown to around 20 labs and comprises a community of over 200 volunteers.

<b>Funding and support</b>: In 2024 the project 'Code for Germany - Digitale Nachhaltigkeit st√§rken' ('Code for Germany - strengthen digital sustainability') is supported by the Deutsche Postcode Lotterie.
