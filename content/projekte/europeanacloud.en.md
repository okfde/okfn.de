Europeana Cloud is a 'best practice network' aiming at establishing a cloud-based system for the Europeana and national aggregators in order to develop tools that can not only describe meta-data, but make actual digital content connected, accessible and editable.
We have developed software solutions for editing metadata and digital content in a cloud-infrastructure for the project.
