Your application for a mortgage is declined, you cannot get a mobile phone contract, and even with your apartment searches you constantly lose out. Why is that? The SCHUFA, of course! Really? Does SCHUFA disadvantage one group of people compared to another? Does it reinforce injustices? This is what we want to find out with OpenSCHUFA.

The SCHUFA score tries to summarise the financial trustworthiness of a person in a few numbers - the scores. These are automatically determined and form the basis for far-reaching decisions. We need to understand this process better.

If algorithms such as those used to calculate the SCHUFA score have an impact on people's lives, they must be comprehensible and transparent.
