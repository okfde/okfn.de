With the Prototype Fund we support socially relevant software projects and increase their sustainable impact through open source as a matter of principle. In short: We support Public Interest Tech. 
We make digital-social innovation possible; with developer groups that bring a wide range of skills to bear in technology design and pass on their good ideas.
With up to 47,500 euros per project and team, the funding fund supports software developers*, hackers* and creative people in implementing sketches for tools and applications in the areas of Civic Tech, data literacy, IT security and software infrastructure. 

In addition to financial support, we offer mentor coaching on the way to the prototype and exchange ideas with our extensive and diverse network of coders, other practitioners and potential users.

The application process is kept as unbureaucratic as possible and adapted to the needs of the self-employed. To date, we have already spent 3 million on 81 projects (status after round 4). The programme runs over a total of 8 funding rounds until 2020.
