Public authorities from federal to local level produce and publish thousands of documents every day. In the context of the omnipresent digitalisation of public services, many goals have been set in recent years concerning the use of open data standards. However, the implementation fell short of the target so far. There is a great need for public authorities to build up knowledge and competences in the field of data provision. With this project the OKF wants to put its focus again on one of its core topics: contributing to the social discourse by offering our expertise in the field of open data.

The goal of open administrative data has several levels: In addition to making government action more transparent and promoting democratic participation of several stakeholders, we also want to emphasize on the benefits of open data standards for internal administrative processes in dialogue with public authorities. In cooperation with our community, we want to bundle know-how and implementation strategies and make them freely available. 

As a documentation basis for the coming years of the project, we have developed the <a href="https://opendata.okfn.de" target="_blank">Open Data Knowledge Hub</a>, where we present our own use cases and also refer to existing materials from other players in the open data universe.

In 2024, we published the first <a href="https://opendataranking.de" target="_blank">Open Data Ranking</a>. With the ranking, we want to put the discussion about open data in Germany on a broader footing and provide an overview of the status quo of open data in Germany for the calendar year 2023. Further updates of the Open Data Ranking are planned for the coming years.
