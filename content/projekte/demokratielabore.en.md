How can we empower children and young people today to become the shapers of tomorrow's society? What makes young people more visible as actors? What role do digital means play here? And how can participation succeed on the digital and social levels?

In order to answer these and other questions, we have developed various workshop formats and materials with the democracy laboratories in order to help a broad target group of children and young people to experience self-efficacy in the field of democracy and technology. The formats are designed for different target groups of extracurricular youth education. On the one hand, they enable workshop leaders to communicate topics such as cyberbullying, fake news, populism, urban design, data protection, influencing, diversity and expression of opinion. On the other hand, self-learning materials were developed with the help of which young people can independently develop social topics and digital tools to implement their own projects. In addition, we have carried out training courses for specialists with the data school in order to make use of the opportunities of digitisation in everyday extracurricular youth work.

**Background** <br>
The world of life and experience of young people in Germany has changed completely within a generation: The digital revolution encompasses all areas of public and private life, shapes our relationships and coexistence in our society. Although the spread of modern technologies and their consumption-oriented use for communication, information and entertainment is already well advanced, the shaping of society is lagging behind mechanisation. It is therefore our goal to reconquer the Internet as a positive creative space and to enable young people to experience self-efficacy experiences in the confrontation with digitality as well as democratic structures and processes.
