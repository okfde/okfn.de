The draft law essentially deals with the implementation of the digital provision of administrative services in state law, which has become mandatory as a result of the Federal Law on Online Access (OZG).

In the view of the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany, the Hessian state government is implementing necessary changes in the area of user accounts and official mailboxes with the draft law, but is missing the opportunity, after more than four years, to formulate further-reaching regulations and objectives with a genuine amendment to the HEGovG as to how the digital transformation could contribute to an efficient and transparent administration.
