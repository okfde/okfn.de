In this legislative period, a new federal strategy for civic engagement is to be developed with the participation of civil society. The last Civic Engagement Strategy dates back to 2010, so it's about time - because a lot has happened! Digital volunteering has grown significantly and new technologies are increasingly permeating our lives.

As part of the official participation of associations, we have submitted a joint declaration of the F5 Alliance.
