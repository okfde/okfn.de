NGOs and non-profit organisations are constantly working to bring about lasting change in society. OKF also works towards social justice and participation on many levels in its numerous projects. However, organisations often lack an inward perspective. With this new series, we want to provide transparency: *How do we make decisions? How do we distribute power? How do we shape collaboration?* [Activism from within](https://okfn.de/en/aktivismus-von-innen/) addresses precisely these issues.
