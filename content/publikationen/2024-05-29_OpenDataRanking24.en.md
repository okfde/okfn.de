We publish the first Open Data Ranking for Germany! Based on the Transparency Ranking, we take a look at the open data landscape in Germany and go beyond simply counting data sets. The analysis of the legal framework, data quality and personnel resources shows that there are considerable differences within Germany with regard to open data. While some federal states are already taking care of linked data, others still lack any basis for data provision.
