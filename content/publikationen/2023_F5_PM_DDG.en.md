Germany is at risk of losing the opportunity to bring internet platforms - such as social networks or online marketplaces - under effective, independent supervision. The Digital Services Act (DSA) aims to protect users' rights online and sets out due diligence obligations for platforms such as TikTok, Facebook and Twitter. In order to effectively achieve these goals, a centralized and well-organized platform supervisory authority in EU member states is needed to quickly and competently handle complaints from affected parties and enforce their rights. The Digital Services Coordinators (DSCs), in cooperation with the EU Commission, are entrusted with this task. However, the German authorities have been arguing about responsibilities for months, delaying the urgently needed preparations for effective platform supervision.
