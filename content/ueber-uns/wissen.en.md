In a democracy, open knowledge is a prerequisite for participation. We want to see a world in which knowledge is freely available both online and offline. This means that we not only use, but also share, further develop, and change the knowledge that we have. This allows us to create a community that everyone can participate in. To do so, we give talks, run initiatives, and research the impact of open data. What makes our work special is that we not only demand open knowledge, but demonstrate with our projects and campaigns how open knowledge can in fact strengthen a democracy.
