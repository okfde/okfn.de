    The Open Knowledge Foundation Germany e. V. is a **non-profit organisation** based in Berlin.
    We develop tools, organise educational programmes, maintain communities, initiate campaigns
    and contribute our expertise to political processes.
    Our [projects](/en/projekte) promote transparency, openness and technological sovereignty.
    We have a volunteer [board](/en/vorstand) and a full-time [team](/team).

    We work in strong alliances with volunteers, activists, educational initiatives
    and administrations. We are connected to like-minded organisations, including the
    international Open Knowledge Network. Our [Code of Conduct](/codeofconduct) applies
    to everyone who participates in our work.

  title: Activism from Within
  copy: |
    In NGOs and non-profit organisations, the focus is often on external impact.
    But those who call for change must also live it internally.
    In this series, we share experiences, challenges and tools from building an organisation
    that puts its values into practice internally.
