Open education is an umbrella term for school-based and extracurricular initiatives that understand education to be participatory, open and relevant to current issues and trends. Education is promoted as a common good and focus is placed on self-directed and competence-oriented learning.

Open education promotes:

* Digitale Mündigkeit (Digital Maturity)
* the development of new forms of social and civic engagement, e.g. through digital volunteering
* the ethical handling of information and communication technologies (see: [Hacker Ethics](https://www.ccc.de/en/hackerethics))

These goals are achieved through participatory learning scenarios and free educational materials (“Open Educational Resources“). This breaks the “teacher-pupil paradigm“ and makes the two roles into equal partners who collaboratively develop learning content. The decentralised creation and free distribution of these materials is an important prerequisite for this.

## Digitale Mündigkeit (Digital Maturity)

Digitale Mündigkeit (Digital Maturity) describes the ability to deal constructively, critically and confidently with digital environments. Only with digital maturity and political engagement from civil society can we question and shape our increasingly digitised society. An understanding of digital technologies (digital literacy), e.g. how to exercise civil rights and duties online, is in this context not an end in itself, but a means to enable social participation. Understanding the need to participate in social and political life in digital spaces safeguards civil society interests and helps to shape society.
