title: Activism from Within
copy: |
  In the day-to-day work of NGOs and non-profit organisations, the focus is on social impact: the projects, campaigns and initiatives we promote externally to change the  world. But what often gets left behind is looking inward. Yet this perspective is fundamental. If we are truly serious about what we proclaim to the outside world, we must also live it within our organisation. We must be activists not only externally, but also internally. 
  
  In our series Activism from Within, we share experiences, challenges and tools for implementing our social demands internally. We address topics such as power, decision-making and conflict, and describe how we deal with them structurally. We describe small steps and concrete measures in our everyday work. We want to encourage other associations, NGOs and activists to take a look inside and share their experiences.
  
  Organisational development is never complete, and we still have a lot of room for improvement. But it's worth sharing even unfinished, imperfect things in order to start a conversation and grow together. Because just as we want to make the world a better place, we also want to work on ourselves every day.

  The series is written by our head of organisational development Sonja Fischbauer. If you have any feedback or questions, feel free to [email Sonja](mailto:sonja.fischbauer@okfn.de). We look forward to hearing from you.
