title: Activism from Within
copy: |
  **In the day-to-day work of NGOs and non-profit organisations, the focus is on
social impact**: the projects, campaigns and initiatives that we
promote externally in order to change the world. **But what often gets left behind
is looking inward.** Yet this perspective is fundamental: If we are truly serious about what we proclaim externally, we must also live it within the organisation.<br><br>

<h3>In this series, we share experiences, challenges and tools for implementing our social demands internally.</h3>

We address topics such as power, decision-making and conflict, and describe how we deal with them structurally. We describe small steps and concrete measures in everyday work.

**Organisational development is never complete, and we still have a lot of room for improvement. But it is worthwhile to share unfinished, imperfect things in order to open up a conversation and grow together.**<br>

We also want to encourage other associations, NGOs and activists to take a look inward and share their experiences.
