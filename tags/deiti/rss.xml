      <description>Statement from the Civil Society Members of the EITI Germany (DEITI) in Support of Gubad Ibadoghlu&#xA;The undersigned Civil Society members of the EITI Germany MSG express their deep concern for the arrest of economist and civil activist Gubad Ibadoghlu in Azerbaijan. Dr. Ibadoghlu has been a relentless champion of transparency and a key, active stakeholder in Azerbaijanâ€™s EITI journey.&#xA;We are deeply disturbed by the reports we heard of the violent nature of his arrest, the harsh conditions of his detention, and the denial of access to medical services reported by his family in light of his rapidly deteriorating health.</description>
