      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statement from the Civil Society Members of the EITI Germany (DEITI) in Support of Gubad Ibadoghlu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The undersigned Civil Society members of the EITI Germany MSG express their deep concern for the arrest of economist and civil activist Gubad Ibadoghlu in Azerbaijan. Dr. Ibadoghlu has been a relentless champion of transparency and a key, active stakeholder in Azerbaijanâ€™s EITI  journey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are deeply disturbed by the reports we heard of the violent nature of his arrest, the harsh conditions of his detention, and the denial of access to medical services reported by his family in light of his rapidly deteriorating health. We urge the Azerbaijan authorities to uphold and respect the rights of civil society actors and the principles of freedom of expression and association.&#xA;We urgently call for his release, for due process to be followed, in accordance with international best practice, and for measures to ensure his health and safety.&#xA;We stand in solidarity with Dr. Ibadoughlu and others like him who promote transparency values at great personal risk.&#xA;In solidarity,&lt;/p&gt;</description>
