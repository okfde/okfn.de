      <title>Copyright Censorship: Cologne Court orders us to take down Glyphosate Report (Update)</title>
      <link>https://okfn.de/blog/2019/04/copyright-censorship-update/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Cologne Regional Court has issued an injunction ordering FragDenStaat to depublish a glyphosate report from the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. The Federal Institute that belongs to Julia Klöckner’s Agriculture Ministry had already sent us a cease-and-desist letter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The glyphosate report was financed by the state and written by civil servants. The fact that copyright is being misused as a censorship right is an attack on freedom of the press! If necessary, we will take the case to the European Court of Justice.&#xA;You can request the report yourself with just one click!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Copyright Censorship: We Got a Cease-and-Desist by the Government </title>
      <link>https://okfn.de/blog/2019/03/copyright-censorship/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The German government has threatened us in order to depublish a government report on the risks of glyphosate. The responsible Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), which reports to the Ministry of Agriculture of Julia Klöckner (CDU), accuses us of copyright infringement and demands that we sign a cease-and-desist declaration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Arne Semsrott, project lead of FragDenStaat: &amp;ldquo;It is shameful to see the Ministry of Agriculture abusing copyright to suppress unwelcome reporting. But we won&amp;rsquo;t be intimidated. If necessary, we will take the case to the European Court of Justice. Copyright must not become a censorship right.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pot Secret - Freeing thousands of Food Safety Reports</title>
      <link>https://okfn.de/blog/2019/01/pot-secret/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://okfn.de/blog/2019/01/pot-secret/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we launched &lt;a href=&#34;https://fragdenstaat.de/kampagnen/lebensmittelkontrolle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pot Secret&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;ldquo;Topf Secret&amp;rdquo; in German) - a platform against secrecy at food authorities. Consumers can use this platform to obtain the results of food safety inspections in restaurants, bakeries, supermarkets and other food-processing businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Together with our partner &lt;a href=&#34;https://foodwatch.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;foodwatch&lt;/a&gt;, we created a platform that enables all people to quickly and easily send pre-formulated freedom of information requests about businesses to the relevant authorities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OffeneGesetze: Opening Germany&#39;s Law Gazette (Update)</title>
      <link>https://okfn.de/blog/2018/12/opening-laws-in-germany/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://okfn.de/blog/2018/12/opening-laws-in-germany/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 12/24/2018&lt;/strong&gt;: In response to OffeneGesetze, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/diginomics/justizministerin-barley-nimmt-dumont-verlag-das-gesetzblatt-weg-15957231.html?GEPC=s3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the German Ministry of Justice has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will create a digital legislative process in the coming years. The ministry is creating a platform on which federal law gazettes &amp;ldquo;can also be freely printed, searched and re-used&amp;rdquo;. There should be unrestricted access, the Justice Minister Katarina Barley said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Law Gazettes are the central documents of German democracy. To pass a law, it has to be published in the Law Gazette. At &lt;a href=&#34;https://offenegesetze.de/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OffeneGesetze.de&lt;/a&gt; they are now freely accessible for the first time. On the portal we provide the documents free of charge and for free re-use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Strengthening the Democratic Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://okfn.de/blog/2018/12/fragdenstaat-in-2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://okfn.de/blog/2018/12/fragdenstaat-in-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;2018 proved, again, why we need to strengthen the infrastructure for democracy. This year, our freedom of information project &lt;a href=&#34;https://fragdenstaat.de&#34;&gt;FragDenStaat&lt;/a&gt; has revealed how the Ministry of Family Affairs cooperates with the Domestic Intelligence Service, we have published the Ministry of the Interior&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://fragdenstaat.de/blog/2018/masterplan-english/&#34;&gt;Master Plan on Migration&lt;/a&gt; and documents on “&lt;a href=&#34;https://fragdenstaat.de/blog/2018/exclusive-internal-diplomatic-report-concentration-camp-conditions-libyan-refugee-camps/&#34;&gt;concentration camp-like prisons&lt;/a&gt;”&amp;nbsp;in Libya.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Democracy is not only under fire in the USA or Brazil, but also in Germany. And yet there is too little controversy about how we can expand democratic structures in this country. We believe that FragDenStaat is an important part of the democratic infrastructure in Germany. In 2018, a total of around 10,000 Freedom Of Information requests&amp;nbsp;were sent to local, state and federal authorities via the platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How can we make governments more transparent and accountable? What are tried and true strategies for opening up government data? The annual OGP summit is an opportunity for the open government community to address its current issues and challenges, and discuss the way ahead. This year, the summit will be held in December in Paris, and you can have your say in shaping the agenda. Together with our friends and partners like &lt;a href=&#34;http://g0v.asia/tw/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;g0v.tw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.open-contracting.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Open Contracting Partnership&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;www.transparency.org&#34;&gt;Transparency International&lt;/a&gt;, we are involved in a couple of sessions -  all of which are listed below. &lt;strong&gt;Your vote would count towards them happening!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Publication to Award - The story of the missing information in the tender cycle</title>
      <link>https://okfn.de/blog/2016/07/from-publication-to-award/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2016 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Billions of euros are spent on procuring for public goods. &lt;a href=&#34;http://digiwhist.eu/publications/towards-a-comprehensive-mapping-of-information-on-public-procurement-tendering-and-its-actors-across-europe/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Our research&lt;/a&gt; shows that some of the procurement could be done more efficient and hence cheaper. Here, having information on the whole public procurement cycle is essential to evaluate the process and monitor it properly. Without information on contract implementation such as the final price paid and completion date, any assessment is incomplete hence can be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When most of the people think about public procurement they either think of the result (e.g. a highway or school being built) or the tender that they saw being announced. However, there is much more to it. Procurement processes sometimes span over long time periods and entail different stages. These stages usually include a call for expression of interest or pre-announcement; a formal call for tenders; announcements on modifications (if any); cancellations or clarifications of the calls (if any); announcements of the winning bidder(s) and details of the contract signature; and information on contract completion and assessment of companies’ performance during implementation. We exclude planning stages here, which are internal procedures and not published openly. &lt;strong&gt;While information on the full procurement process is crucial to assess its quality, publicly available information typically has considerable gaps in Europe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Who has won the contract? - Identifying the bidders of public procurement processes</title>
      <link>https://okfn.de/blog/2016/06/who-has-won-the-contract/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2016 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://okfn.de/blog/2016/06/who-has-won-the-contract/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of years there has been a strong push by political leaders and civil society towards making beneficial ownership more transparent. There are various very good reasons for this, varying from making it more difficult to disguising the beneficiary of transactions, or using shell companies for illicit purposes such as money laundering and hiding stolen assets. In the arena of public procurement there is the suggestion to start by publishing beneficial ownership for bidders for public tenders. We applaud this but we do not think this is enough. To be able to trace where public money goes, prevent collusion in public procurement, and track organisational performance more broadly the most important prerequisite is to have &lt;strong&gt;unique identifiers for both bidders and buyers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
