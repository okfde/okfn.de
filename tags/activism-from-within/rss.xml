      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this article, we show how we organise ourselves internally. We describe the structures we use to promote co-determination and distribute power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In our work, we strive for a democratic, sustainable and resilient future based on openness, participation and transparency. In order to live up to this aspiration within our organisation, we need to organise our internal collaboration accordingly: we need a solid governance model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A governance model is a plan for how people in a group make decisions. It regulates questions such as: &lt;em&gt;Who is allowed to decide what? Who is responsible for what?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NGOs and non-profit organisations are constantly working to bring about lasting change in society. OKF also works towards social justice and participation on many levels in its numerous projects. However, organisations often lack an inward perspective. With this new series, we want to provide transparency: &lt;em&gt;How do we make decisions? How do we distribute power? How do we shape collaboration?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://okfn.de/aktivismus-von-innen/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Activism from Within&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; addresses precisely these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the next three weeks, we will give you an insight into our structures and share experiences, challenges and tools for implementing our social demands internally.&#xA;In &lt;strong&gt;part 1&lt;/strong&gt;, we show how we organise ourselves internally. We describe the structures we use to promote co-determination and distribute power. In &lt;strong&gt;part 2&lt;/strong&gt;, we share instructions for an exercise we use to facilitate discussions about power structures in our organisation. And finally, in &lt;strong&gt;part 3&lt;/strong&gt;, we share our first version of a conflict routine: instructions on how to proceed when you find yourself in a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
